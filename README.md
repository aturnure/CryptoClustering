# CryptoClustering
Utilization of unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Prepare the Data
1. Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.
2. Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

# Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k 

# Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data

# Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
1. Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.
2. Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component.
3. Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

# Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k

# Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the PCA data
